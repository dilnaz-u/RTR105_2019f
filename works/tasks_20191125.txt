2. Get familiar with Loop operators:
create directory - loops and subdirectories - for and while
inside loops/while directory obligatory try examples from:
https://github.com/tatusmatrix/RTR105_2019/tree/master/darbiM01/loops/while
inside loops/for directory obligatory try examples from:
https://github.com/tatusmatrix/RTR105_2019/tree/master/darbiM01/loops/for
also You can try, for example:

3. At 13:30 I will start to ask everyone:
how codes with conditions and loops are working?
